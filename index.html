        <p>One of the most common questions in diabetes research is how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> relates to the likelihood of having diabetes. We know that excess body weight can be a risk factor for developing diabetes, but what’s the exact connection? Does a higher BMI correlate with a higher likelihood of being diabetic?</p>

        <p>By understanding the relationship between BMI and diabetes risk, this project can provide valuable insights that can be used for <strong>early detection and prevention</strong> of diabetes. The visualizations will help identify high-risk individuals, making it easier to target preventative measures, such as lifestyle changes or medical interventions, at an earlier stage, potentially reducing the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems and improving public health outcomes.</p>

        <p>To explore this question, we'll visualize the relationship between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong>, with different colors representing the diabetes status (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic). By plotting this, we can see if there’s any noticeable pattern between BMI and the likelihood of having diabetes across different age groups.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we can further break down this relationship by using histograms to compare the BMI distribution between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This will help us understand whether people with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic, or if other factors come into play.</p>

    <h2>Uncovering Relationships in the Data: The Correlation Matrix</h2>

    <p>To understand how the different factors in our dataset relate to each other, we use a tool called a <strong>correlation matrix</strong>. This matrix helps us see how strongly two features are connected. For example, we might discover that <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> are closely related, which makes sense since both are key indicators when assessing the likelihood of diabetes.</p>

    <p>We then visualize this matrix with a <strong>heatmap</strong>, which turns the correlation values into a color-coded chart. This allows us to quickly spot patterns and relationships between features, giving us a clearer picture of the data.</p>

    <p>This step is crucial for figuring out which features are the most important for understanding diabetes and where we should focus our analysis next.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing Key Relationships: Correlation Between AGE, BMI, HbA1c, and Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>After identifying the variables that seemed to have the most potential impact on diabetes, we decided to zoom in on a few key factors: <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong>Diabetic status</strong>. These are all crucial indicators for understanding diabetes risk, so it’s important to see how they interact with one another.</p>

    <p>We calculated the correlation matrix for these variables to identify any strong relationships. The resulting heatmap visually shows us how closely related each of these factors is. For instance, we might see a strong positive correlation between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong>, which makes sense because both are important in assessing diabetes risk.</p>

    <p>By visualizing the correlation matrix, we can easily spot patterns that will help guide our further analysis and give us deeper insights into how these factors contribute to diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing HbA1c Distribution by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand how <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels vary between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, we can visualize the distribution of this key indicator using a <strong>box plot</strong>. <strong>HbA1c</strong> is an important measure for diagnosing and managing diabetes, as it reflects the average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months.</p>

    <p>In this visualization, the x-axis represents the <strong>Diabetes Status</strong> (whether an individual is Diabetic or Non-Diabetic), and the y-axis shows the <strong>HbA1c</strong> values. The box plot helps us see the spread of HbA1c levels within each group, including the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers.</p>

    <p>From the plot, we can easily compare the central tendencies and variability of <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels across different diabetes statuses, offering insights into how HbA1c differs between individuals with and without diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Distribution of BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>Understanding how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> varies across different diabetes statuses can offer valuable insights into the relationship between weight and diabetes risk. To explore this, we’ve plotted <strong>histograms</strong> of BMI values for three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <p>Each histogram shows the distribution of BMI for individuals within each group, with the color coding indicating the diabetes status: <strong>red</strong> for Diabetic, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic, and <strong>green</strong> for PreDiabetes. The <strong>KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)</strong> curve is also included to give us a smooth estimate of the distribution.</p>

    <p>By comparing these histograms, we can visually assess how the BMI distribution differs between the groups. This helps us understand whether Diabetic individuals tend to have higher BMIs than NonDiabetic individuals, and how PreDiabetes fits into the picture. This visualization allows us to see patterns that may point to BMI as a key factor in the likelihood of developing diabetes.</p>

    <h2>BMI vs AGE by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To explore how <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong> are related to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that shows the relationship between these two variables across three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <p>In this plot, we use different colors to represent each group: <strong>red</strong> for Diabetic, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic, and <strong>green</strong> for PreDiabetes. Each point on the scatter plot corresponds to an individual, with their <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and their <strong>BMI</strong> on the y-axis.</p>

    <p>We’ve also added a <strong>horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong>, which is often used as a threshold to differentiate between normal weight and overweight. This line provides context for how BMI levels change across different age groups and diabetes statuses. It can also help us see if individuals with a higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic or in the prediabetes range.</p>

    <p>By examining this scatter plot, we can visually assess whether there are trends, such as whether older individuals tend to have higher BMIs or whether there’s a clear distinction in BMI between those with diabetes and those without.</p>

    <h2>AGE vs HbA1c by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand how <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> relate to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot where we plot <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and <strong>HbA1c</strong> on the y-axis. The plot is colored based on diabetes status, with different hues representing Diabetic individuals, NonDiabetic individuals, and PreDiabetes individuals.</p>

    <p>In this visualization, we’ve added a <strong>horizontal line at HbA1c = 6.5</strong>, which is the threshold often used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is generally considered indicative of diabetes. This line provides an important reference point to see how <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> interact and whether certain age groups have HbA1c levels that cross this threshold.</p>

    <p>By examining this plot, we can visually assess how <strong>age</strong> influences <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels and whether there are clear patterns indicating that older individuals or those in certain diabetes categories tend to have higher HbA1c values, which could indicate poor blood sugar control.</p>

    <h2>HbA1c vs BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>In this scatter plot, we explore the relationship between <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> for individuals categorized as <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong>. We use different colors to represent each group: <strong>red</strong> for Diabetic individuals, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic individuals, and <strong>green</strong> for PreDiabetes individuals.</p>

    <p>We have also drawn several threshold lines on the plot to help us interpret the data more effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong>, representing the typical cutoff for overweight, which can be indicative of a higher risk for diabetes.</li>
        <li>Two <strong>vertical lines for HbA1c thresholds</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>purple line at HbA1c = 5.7%</strong>, marking the cutoff for PreDiabetes.</li>
                <li>An <strong>orange line at HbA1c = 6.5%</strong>, marking the threshold for a diabetes diagnosis.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>By examining this plot, we can assess how <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> interact across different diabetes statuses. It allows us to observe whether individuals with higher HbA1c levels tend to have higher BMIs, and if so, at what points the groups begin to overlap or diverge. This insight could help in understanding how elevated HbA1c and BMI might together indicate a higher likelihood of diabetes or prediabetes.</p>
