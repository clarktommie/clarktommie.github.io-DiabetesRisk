        <h2>Exploring the Link Between BMI and Diabetes Risk</h2>

        <p>One of the most common questions in diabetes research is how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> relates to the likelihood of having diabetes. We know that excess body weight can be a risk factor for developing diabetes, but what’s the exact connection? Does a higher BMI correlate with a higher likelihood of being diabetic?</p>

        <p>By understanding the relationship between BMI and diabetes risk, this project can provide valuable insights that can be used for <strong>early detection and prevention</strong> of diabetes. The visualizations will help identify high-risk individuals, making it easier to target preventative measures, such as lifestyle changes or medical interventions, at an earlier stage, potentially reducing the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems and improving public health outcomes.</p>

        <p>To explore this question, we'll visualize the relationship between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong>, with different colors representing the diabetes status (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic). By plotting this, we can see if there’s any noticeable pattern between BMI and the likelihood of having diabetes across different age groups.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we can further break down this relationship by using histograms to compare the BMI distribution between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This will help us understand whether people with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic, or if other factors come into play.</p>

    <h2>Uncovering Relationships in the Data: The Correlation Matrix</h2>

    <p>To understand how the different factors in our dataset relate to each other, we use a tool called a <strong>correlation matrix</strong>. This matrix helps us see how strongly two features are connected. For example, we might discover that <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> are closely related, which makes sense since both are key indicators when assessing the likelihood of diabetes.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
        <p style="flex: 1;">We then visualize this matrix with a <strong>heatmap</strong>, which turns the correlation values into a color-coded chart. This allows us to quickly spot patterns and relationships between features, giving us a clearer picture of the data.</p>

    <p>This step is crucial for figuring out which features are the most important for understanding diabetes and where we should focus our analysis next.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing Key Relationships: Correlation Between AGE, BMI, HbA1c, and Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>After identifying the variables that seemed to have the most potential impact on diabetes, we decided to zoom in on a few key factors: <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong>Diabetic status</strong>. These are all crucial indicators for understanding diabetes risk, so it’s important to see how they interact with one another.</p>

    <p>We calculated the correlation matrix for these variables to identify any strong relationships. The resulting heatmap visually shows us how closely related each of these factors is. For instance, we might see a strong positive correlation between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong>, which makes sense because both are important in assessing diabetes risk.</p>

    <p>By visualizing the correlation matrix, we can easily spot patterns that will help guide our further analysis and give us deeper insights into how these factors contribute to diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing HbA1c Distribution by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand how <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels vary between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, we can visualize the distribution of this key indicator using a <strong>box plot</strong>. <strong>HbA1c</strong> is an important measure for diagnosing and managing diabetes, as it reflects the average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>The x-axis represents the <strong>Diabetes Status</strong> (whether an individual is Diabetic or Non-Diabetic), while the y-axis shows the <strong>HbA1c</strong> values. The box plot provides a clear visualization of the spread of HbA1c levels within each group, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Median:</strong> The central line inside the box.</li>
                <li><strong>Interquartile Range (IQR):</strong> The box itself, showing the middle 50% of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Individual points beyond the whiskers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This plot allows us to compare the central tendencies and variability of <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels across different diabetes statuses, providing valuable insights into how HbA1c differs between individuals with and without diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Distribution of BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>Understanding how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> varies across different diabetes statuses can offer valuable insights into the relationship between weight and diabetes risk. To explore this, we’ve plotted <strong>histograms</strong> of BMI values for three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>Each histogram displays the distribution of BMI within each group, using distinct colors for easy comparison:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> Diabetic</li>
                <li><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> NonDiabetic</li>
                <li><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> PreDiabetes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, a <strong>Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)</strong> curve is included to provide a smooth estimate of the distribution.</p>
            <p>By comparing these histograms, we can visually assess differences in BMI distribution among the groups. This helps determine whether individuals with diabetes tend to have higher BMIs and how PreDiabetes fits into the pattern. Recognizing these trends can aid in understanding BMI’s role in diabetes risk.</p>

    <h2>BMI vs AGE by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To explore how <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong> are related to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that visualizes their relationship across three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>The plot uses distinct colors for each group to highlight their distribution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> Diabetic</li>
                <li><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> NonDiabetic</li>
                <li><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> PreDiabetes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each point represents an individual, with <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and <strong>BMI</strong> on the y-axis.</p>
            <p>A <strong>horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong> is included, which is a commonly used threshold for distinguishing normal weight from overweight. This reference line helps us examine whether individuals with a higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic or in the prediabetes range.</p>
            <p>By analyzing this scatter plot, we can assess trends such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do older individuals tend to have higher BMIs?</li>
                <li>Is there a clear distinction in BMI between those with and without diabetes?</li>
                <li>Are most diabetic individuals above the BMI threshold of 25?</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>AGE vs HbA1c by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand how <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> relate to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that visualizes these variables: <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and <strong>HbA1c</strong> on the y-axis. The plot is color-coded to differentiate between the groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>In this visualization, we’ve included a <strong>horizontal line at HbA1c = 6.5%</strong>, which is the typical threshold for diagnosing diabetes. This line serves as an important reference point, helping us identify individuals whose HbA1c levels are indicative of diabetes.</p>
            <p>The scatter plot allows us to explore the interaction between <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong>, shedding light on whether certain age groups are more likely to exceed this threshold and experience poor blood sugar control.</p>
            <p>By examining the plot, we can assess patterns such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are older individuals more likely to have higher HbA1c levels?</li>
                <li>Do Diabetic individuals have higher HbA1c levels compared to NonDiabetic individuals?</li>
                <li>How does PreDiabetes compare in terms of age and HbA1c distribution?</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>HbA1c vs BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>In this scatter plot, we explore the relationship between <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> for individuals categorized as <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong>. Different colors are used to represent each group: <strong>red</strong> for Diabetic, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic, and <strong>green</strong> for PreDiabetes individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>We’ve also included threshold lines to better interpret the data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong>, representing the typical cutoff for overweight, which can indicate a higher risk for diabetes.</li>
                <li>Two <strong>vertical lines for HbA1c thresholds</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>purple line at HbA1c = 5.7%</strong>, marking the cutoff for PreDiabetes.</li>
                        <li>An <strong>orange line at HbA1c = 6.5%</strong>, marking the threshold for a diabetes diagnosis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By examining this plot, we can assess how <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> interact across different diabetes statuses. This visualization helps identify if individuals with higher HbA1c tend to have higher BMI values, and where the groups begin to overlap or diverge, suggesting insights into how these factors together could influence diabetes risk.</p>
