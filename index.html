        <p>One of the most common questions in diabetes research is how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> relates to the likelihood of having diabetes. We know that excess body weight can be a risk factor for developing diabetes, but what’s the exact connection? Does a higher BMI correlate with a higher likelihood of being diabetic?</p>

        <p>By understanding the relationship between BMI and diabetes risk, this project can provide valuable insights that can be used for <strong>early detection and prevention</strong> of diabetes. The visualizations will help identify high-risk individuals, making it easier to target preventative measures, such as lifestyle changes or medical interventions, at an earlier stage, potentially reducing the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems and improving public health outcomes.</p>

        <p>To explore this question, we'll visualize the relationship between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong>, with different colors representing the diabetes status (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic). By plotting this, we can see if there’s any noticeable pattern between BMI and the likelihood of having diabetes across different age groups.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we can further break down this relationship by using histograms to compare the BMI distribution between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This will help us understand whether people with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic, or if other factors come into play.</p>

    <h2>Uncovering Relationships in the Data: The Correlation Matrix</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>To understand how different factors in our dataset relate to each other, we use a correlation matrix. This allows us to identify strong connections between features and better understand the underlying relationships in the data.</p>

            <p>For example, we observe that <strong>BMI</strong> has a strong positive correlation with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (0.589) and a moderate positive correlation with <strong>HbA1c</strong> (0.455). This suggests that individuals with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic and may also exhibit higher HbA1c levels, a critical marker for diabetes risk.</p>

            <p>Additionally, <strong>age</strong> shows a moderate positive correlation with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (0.478), indicating that older individuals are more likely to develop diabetes. <strong>HbA1c</strong> also strongly correlates with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (0.567), further emphasizing the importance of HbA1c levels in predicting diabetes.</p>

            <p>These key correlations—particularly between BMI, HbA1c, age, and diabetes status—will guide our next visualization, where we will explore how these features interact in more detail.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing Key Relationships: Correlation Between AGE, BMI, HbA1c, and Diabetes Status</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>As we dug deeper into the data, we decided to zoom in on four key factors that we believed had a major impact on diabetes risk: <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong>Diabetic status</strong>. These are all important markers when trying to assess someone’s likelihood of developing diabetes, so understanding how they relate to one another was critical.</p>

            <p>We started by calculating the correlation between these variables, which gave us a clearer picture of their connections. What we found was telling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There’s a <strong>strong positive relationship</strong> between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>Diabetic status</strong> (0.589). This makes sense: higher BMI is often linked with a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is what we’re seeing here.</li>
                <li><strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> are also <strong>moderately correlated</strong> (0.455), further supporting the idea that individuals with higher BMI tend to have elevated HbA1c levels, another key indicator of diabetes.</li>
                <li>We also found that <strong>AGE</strong> has a <strong>moderate positive correlation</strong> with <strong>Diabetic status</strong> (0.478), indicating that as people get older, the likelihood of being diabetic increases—a well-known trend in diabetes research.</li>
                <li>Lastly, <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>Diabetic status</strong> showed a <strong>strong correlation</strong> (0.567), emphasizing the role HbA1c plays in diagnosing and predicting diabetes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By visualizing these correlations in a heatmap, we could easily spot these connections and understand how each factor plays a role in the bigger picture of diabetes risk. This insight sets the stage for our next step, where we’ll dive deeper into how BMI, AGE, and HbA1c interact with one another to better understand the full scope of diabetes risk.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing HbA1c Distribution by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>In the box plot, the x-axis represents <strong>Diabetes Status</strong>, where 0 corresponds to non-diabetic individuals and 1 corresponds to those with diabetes. The y-axis displays <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels, which are crucial for understanding blood sugar control.</p>

            <p>For the Non-Diabetic group (represented by 0), the box plot shows that most HbA1c values fall between 4.3 and 5.8, with the median around 5.0. This indicates that non-diabetic individuals typically have normal blood sugar levels.</p>

            <p>In contrast, the Diabetic group (represented by 1) has a much higher spread of HbA1c values, ranging from 2.0 to 16.0. The bulk of the data falls between 7.3 and 10.6, with the median at 8.9. The plot also shows a few extreme outliers, with some individuals having HbA1c values as high as 16.0, reflecting poorly controlled blood sugar.</p>

            <p>This comparison between the two groups visually highlights how much more variable and higher <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels are in individuals with diabetes compared to those without.</p>

    <h2>BMI vs AGE by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To explore how <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong> are related to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that shows the relationship between these two variables across three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <p>In this plot, we use different colors to represent each group:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> Diabetic</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> NonDiabetic</li>
        <li><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> PreDiabetes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each point on the scatter plot corresponds to an individual, with their <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and their <strong>BMI</strong> on the y-axis. A <strong>horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong> was added to highlight the threshold between normal weight and overweight.</p>

    <p>Looking at the data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> have a higher average BMI (30.82), with values ranging from 19.0 to 47.75. This group also tends to be older, with an average age of 55.4 years. The wide range of BMI values suggests that diabetes affects individuals across various weight categories, but with a strong tendency toward higher BMIs as age increases.</li>
        <li><strong>NonDiabetic individuals</strong> have a lower average BMI (22.35), typically falling within a normal weight range (between 19.0 and 24.60). The average age of this group is 44.3 years, reflecting a younger population compared to diabetics. The BMI distribution is tighter, indicating fewer instances of overweight or obesity in this group.</li>
        <li><strong>PreDiabetes individuals</strong> have an average BMI of 24.11, with values ranging from 19.0 to 32.0. Their BMI distribution suggests that they are at an increased risk of developing diabetes, with more individuals falling into the overweight category but not yet reaching the higher BMI levels seen in the diabetic group. Their average age is 43.4 years, which is similar to non-diabetic individuals, but the higher BMI hints at a potential progression towards diabetes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These findings reinforce the earlier visual observations that <strong>Diabetic</strong> individuals generally have higher BMIs, particularly in older age groups, while <strong>NonDiabetic</strong> individuals maintain a lower BMI and are younger on average. <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals occupy a middle ground, with higher BMIs than non-diabetics but lower than those in the diabetic group. This pattern highlights the relationship between BMI and diabetes status, underscoring the importance of BMI as a risk factor in the development of diabetes.</p>

    <h2>Distribution of BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To understand how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> differs across various diabetes statuses, we’ve plotted histograms for three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <p>The histograms are color-coded to differentiate between the groups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> Diabetic</li>
        <li><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> NonDiabetic</li>
        <li><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> PreDiabetes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each histogram displays the spread of BMI values for each group, with the <strong>Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)</strong> curve providing a smooth estimation of the distribution.</p>

    <p>Looking at the data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> tend to have a higher average BMI (30.82) with a range from 19.0 to 47.75. The BMI for this group is more spread out, with a noticeable peak around 30.0, showing that a significant portion of diabetic individuals fall within the higher BMI range.</li>
        <li><strong>NonDiabetic individuals</strong> have a lower average BMI (22.35) and a tighter distribution, with a range from 19.0 to 24.60. This group shows a concentration of BMI values around 22.0, which suggests that most non-diabetic individuals fall within a normal BMI range.</li>
        <li><strong>PreDiabetes individuals</strong> have an average BMI of 24.11, with a range from 19.0 to 32.0. The distribution shows a slight shift toward higher BMI compared to non-diabetics, but not as high as the diabetic group.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These histograms make it clear that Diabetic individuals generally have higher BMIs than NonDiabetic individuals, with PreDiabetes falling somewhere in between. This pattern suggests a relationship between higher BMI and an increased likelihood of developing diabetes, which is something to consider for further analysis.</p>

    <h2>AGE vs HbA1c by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand how <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> relate to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that visualizes these variables: <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and <strong>HbA1c</strong> on the y-axis. The plot is color-coded to differentiate between the groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 40px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>In this visualization, we’ve included a <strong>horizontal line at HbA1c = 6.5%</strong>, which is the typical threshold for diagnosing diabetes. This line serves as an important reference point, helping us identify individuals whose HbA1c levels are indicative of diabetes.</p>
            <p>The scatter plot allows us to explore the interaction between <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong>, shedding light on whether certain age groups are more likely to exceed this threshold and experience poor blood sugar control.</p>
            <p>By examining the plot, we can assess patterns such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are older individuals more likely to have higher HbA1c levels?</li>
                <li>Do Diabetic individuals have higher HbA1c levels compared to NonDiabetic individuals?</li>
                <li>How does PreDiabetes compare in terms of age and HbA1c distribution?</li>

    <h2>HbA1c vs BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>In this scatter plot, we explore the relationship between <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> for individuals categorized as <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong>. Different colors represent each group: <strong>red</strong> for Diabetic, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic, and <strong>green</strong> for PreDiabetes.</p>

            <p>Threshold lines help interpret the data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong> (overweight threshold).</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical lines for HbA1c thresholds</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purple line at 5.7%</strong> (PreDiabetes cutoff).</li>
                        <li><strong>Orange line at 6.5%</strong> (Diabetes threshold).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This visualization highlights the interaction between BMI and HbA1c, showing how individuals with higher HbA1c levels often have elevated BMIs. The overlap and divergence between groups provide insight into the role of BMI and HbA1c in diabetes risk.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Throughout this project, we explored diabetes risk factors using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and histograms. The scatter plot demonstrated how BMI and HbA1c interact across different diabetes statuses, with Diabetic individuals tending to have higher BMI and HbA1c values.</p>

    <p>The correlation matrix provided quantitative confirmation of these relationships. It revealed a moderate positive correlation between <strong>BMI and HbA1c (0.46)</strong>, suggesting that individuals with higher BMI often have elevated HbA1c levels. Additionally, we found that <strong>AGE correlates more strongly with Diabetic status (0.48)</strong>, indicating that older individuals are more likely to be diabetic. The histograms further reinforced these trends, showing that Diabetic individuals generally have higher BMI values, while NonDiabetic individuals have lower, more concentrated BMI distributions.</p>

    <p>Reflecting on this project, it has been an insightful learning experience, reinforcing the power of data visualization and statistical analysis in understanding health data. The combination of scatter plots, correlation matrices, and histograms allowed us to build a comprehensive picture of diabetes risk factors. This analysis highlights the importance of considering multiple factors—BMI, HbA1c, and AGE—when assessing diabetes risk. The patterns observed suggest that individuals with higher BMI and HbA1c are at greater risk, and AGE plays a significant role in this likelihood.</p>

    <p>This project underscored the importance of multidimensional analysis in medical research and the value of using data-driven insights to inform healthcare decisions. Understanding the interplay between BMI, HbA1c, and AGE can help guide future research and improve risk assessment strategies for diabetes prevention and management.</p>
