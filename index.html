    <h1>Exploring the Links Between BMI, Age, HbA1c, and Diabetes Risk</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -10px;">Tommie Clark | February 6, 2025</p>

    <p>One of the most common questions in diabetes research is how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> relates to the likelihood of having diabetes. We know that excess body weight can be a risk factor for developing diabetes, but what’s the exact connection? Does a higher BMI correlate with a higher likelihood of being diabetic?</p>

    <p>By understanding the relationship between BMI and diabetes risk, this project can provide valuable insights that can be used for <strong>early detection and prevention</strong> of diabetes. The visualizations will help identify high-risk individuals, making it easier to target preventative measures, such as lifestyle changes or medical interventions, at an earlier stage, potentially reducing the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems and improving public health outcomes.</p>

    <p>To explore this question, we'll visualize the relationship between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong>, with different colors representing the diabetes status (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic). By plotting this, we can see if there’s any noticeable pattern between BMI and the likelihood of having diabetes across different age groups.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we can further break down this relationship by using histograms to compare the BMI distribution between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. This will help us understand whether people with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic, or if other factors come into play.</p>

    <h2>Scrubbing and Cleaning the Data</h2>
    <h3>Initial Data Exploration</h3>

    <p>Understanding the structure of our dataset is a crucial first step in the analysis process. A quick look at the first few rows helps us familiarize ourselves with the available features, their formats, and any potential inconsistencies that might need attention.</p>

    <p>The snapshot below provides an overview of the dataset, allowing us to identify key variables and spot any immediate concerns, such as missing values or irrelevant columns, before proceeding with the cleaning process.</p>

         alt="Dataset Snapshot - First Five Rows">

    <h3>Kicking Off the Data Cleaning Process</h3>

    <p>Before we can begin analyzing our data, it's essential to clean it up and remove any unnecessary clutter. At the start of our cleaning process, we focus on dropping irrelevant columns that won’t contribute to our analysis.</p>

    <p>In this step, we're removing the <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>No_Pation</strong> columns. The <strong>ID</strong> column usually serves as a unique identifier for each entry, but it doesn't add any value for our analysis. Similarly, <strong>No_Pation</strong> appears to be a label or reference number, which we also don’t need for exploring relationships or patterns in the data.</p>

    <p>By dropping these columns, we’re streamlining the dataset and keeping only the information that matters for our analysis going forward.</p>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarktommie/clarktommie.github.io-DiabetesRisk/92be6f7de89298e28eccc60de29838b0d6899225/dropping_columns_1.jpeg"

    <h3>Checking for Missing Values</h3>

    <p>Now that we’ve cleaned up some unnecessary columns, the next step is to ensure that our dataset is complete. <strong>Missing values</strong> can be a common issue in many datasets, and they can cause problems during analysis or modeling if not handled properly.</p>

    <p>In this step, we check for any missing values across the entire dataset using the <code>isnull()</code> function. This function will identify missing values in each column, and by applying <code>sum()</code>, we can count how many are present in each column. This gives us a clear picture of where the data might be incomplete.</p>

    <p>Once we determine where the missing values are, we can decide on the best way to handle them—whether by filling them in, removing rows, or using other techniques. This ensures our analysis remains accurate and free from biases caused by incomplete data.</p>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarktommie/clarktommie.github.io-DiabetesRisk/5002c53a0e31179675a915ccb181e1a6d33c8486/check_for_missing_values.jpeg" 
         alt="Checking for Missing Values in the Dataset">

    <h3>Handling Missing Values: Why Dropping Rows Makes Sense</h3>

    <p>After checking for missing values in our dataset, we found that only a few entries were incomplete. Specifically, columns like <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>Urea</strong>, and <strong>HbA1c</strong> had a small number of missing values—ranging from 1 to 3 missing entries per column.</p>

    <p>Given that such a small percentage of data is missing, <strong>dropping these rows</strong> is a practical approach. Here’s why:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimal Data Loss:</strong> Since only a few rows are affected, removing them won’t significantly impact the dataset’s size or representativeness.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> This method is straightforward and avoids potential biases introduced by imputing missing values.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures that all remaining rows are complete, making the dataset more reliable for analysis and modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After removing these rows, we verified that no missing values remain, leaving us with a clean dataset, ready for further analysis.</p>

         alt="Dropped Rows with Missing Values">

    <h3>Converting Categories into Dummy Variables</h3>

    <p>With our dataset cleaned, the next step is to transform categorical data into a format that’s easier to analyze. Specifically, we’re converting the <strong>Gender</strong> and <strong>CLASS</strong> columns into <em>dummy variables</em>.</p>

    <p>We begin with the <strong>Gender</strong> column, creating separate columns for each gender category. Each row is assigned a value of 1 or 0 in these new columns, indicating whether the individual belongs to a specific gender category.</p>

    <p>Next, we apply the same process to the <strong>CLASS</strong> column, which represents diabetes status. Instead of simple "Y" or "N" labels, this conversion produces distinct columns for each possible class (e.g., diabetic, non-diabetic, pre-diabetic), making it easier to work with during analysis.</p>

    <p>Once the transformation is complete, we remove the original <strong>Gender</strong> column, as it is no longer needed in its previous form.</p>

    <p>These changes ensure that our dataset is structured optimally for analysis and modeling.</p>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarktommie/clarktommie.github.io-DiabetesRisk/457d26d8d871f23317a88d18fa32a49b7339fdfe/encoding.jpeg" 
         alt="Encoding categorical variables into dummy variables">

    <h3>Tidying Up the Dataset for Easier Analysis</h3>

    <p>As we refine our dataset, we find opportunities to streamline and enhance its structure. Some columns can be merged, while others need clearer, more intuitive names to improve readability and usability.</p>

    <p>First, we address a redundancy in the <strong>Gender</strong> column. Our dataset contains two separate columns for female gender—one labeled with an uppercase "F" and the other with a lowercase "f." To eliminate this duplication, we merge them into a single column named <strong>Female</strong>.</p>

    <p>Next, we simplify the representation of diabetes status. Previously, we had multiple columns indicating whether a person was diabetic or not. We consolidate these into two clear categories: <strong>NonDiabetic</strong> and <strong>Diabetic</strong>, making future analysis more efficient.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we enhance column names for better clarity. The column for male gender is renamed to <strong>Male</strong>, and the one indicating the pre-diabetic stage is updated to <strong>PreDiabetes</strong>. These changes ensure consistency and ease of interpretation.</p>

    <p>With these refinements, our dataset is now cleaner and more structured, setting the stage for deeper analysis.</p>

    <h2>Uncovering Relationships in the Data: The Correlation Matrix</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>To understand how different factors in our dataset relate to each other, we use a correlation matrix. This allows us to identify strong connections between features and better understand the underlying relationships in the data.</p>

            <p>For example, we observe that <strong>BMI</strong> has a strong positive correlation with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (0.589) and a moderate positive correlation with <strong>HbA1c</strong> (0.455). This suggests that individuals with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic and may also exhibit higher HbA1c levels, a critical marker for diabetes risk.</p>

            <p>Additionally, <strong>age</strong> shows a moderate positive correlation with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (0.478), indicating that older individuals are more likely to develop diabetes. <strong>HbA1c</strong> also strongly correlates with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (0.567), further emphasizing the importance of HbA1c levels in predicting diabetes.</p>

            <p>These key correlations—particularly between BMI, HbA1c, age, and diabetes status—will guide our next visualization, where we will explore how these features interact in more detail.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing Key Relationships: Correlation Between AGE, BMI, HbA1c, and Diabetes Status</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>As we dug deeper into the data, we decided to zoom in on four key factors that we believed had a major impact on diabetes risk: <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong>Diabetic status</strong>. These are all important markers when trying to assess someone’s likelihood of developing diabetes, so understanding how they relate to one another was critical.</p>

            <p>We started by calculating the correlation between these variables, which gave us a clearer picture of their connections. What we found was telling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There’s a <strong>strong positive relationship</strong> between <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>Diabetic status</strong> (0.589). This makes sense: higher BMI is often linked with a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is what we’re seeing here.</li>
                <li><strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> are also <strong>moderately correlated</strong> (0.455), further supporting the idea that individuals with higher BMI tend to have elevated HbA1c levels, another key indicator of diabetes.</li>
                <li>We also found that <strong>AGE</strong> has a <strong>moderate positive correlation</strong> with <strong>Diabetic status</strong> (0.478), indicating that as people get older, the likelihood of being diabetic increases—a well-known trend in diabetes research.</li>
                <li>Lastly, <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>Diabetic status</strong> showed a <strong>strong correlation</strong> (0.567), emphasizing the role HbA1c plays in diagnosing and predicting diabetes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By visualizing these correlations in a heatmap, we could easily spot these connections and understand how each factor plays a role in the bigger picture of diabetes risk. This insight sets the stage for our next step, where we’ll dive deeper into how BMI, AGE, and HbA1c interact with one another to better understand the full scope of diabetes risk.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing HbA1c Distribution by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>In the box plot, the x-axis represents <strong>Diabetes Status</strong>, where 0 corresponds to non-diabetic individuals and 1 corresponds to those with diabetes. The y-axis displays <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels, which are crucial for understanding blood sugar control.</p>

            <p>For the Non-Diabetic group (represented by 0), the box plot shows that most HbA1c values fall between 4.3 and 5.8, with the median around 5.0. This indicates that non-diabetic individuals typically have normal blood sugar levels.</p>

            <p>In contrast, the Diabetic group (represented by 1) has a much higher spread of HbA1c values, ranging from 2.0 to 16.0. The bulk of the data falls between 7.3 and 10.6, with the median at 8.9. The plot also shows a few extreme outliers, with some individuals having HbA1c values as high as 16.0, reflecting poorly controlled blood sugar.</p>

            <p>This comparison between the two groups visually highlights how much more variable and higher <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels are in individuals with diabetes compared to those without.</p>

    <h2>Distribution of BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To understand how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> differs across various diabetes statuses, we’ve plotted histograms for three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 40px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>Each histogram shows the spread of BMI values for each group, with a <strong>Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)</strong> curve providing a smooth estimation of the distribution.</p>
            <p>Key observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> have a higher average BMI (30.82), with a peak around 30.0, indicating a tendency toward overweight and obesity.</li>
                <li><strong>NonDiabetic individuals</strong> have a lower average BMI (22.35), with most values clustering around 22.0, within a normal BMI range.</li>
                <li><strong>PreDiabetes individuals</strong> have an average BMI of 24.11, showing a shift toward higher BMI compared to non-diabetics but not reaching diabetic levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These patterns highlight the connection between higher BMI and an increased likelihood of developing diabetes, reinforcing BMI’s role as a risk factor.</p>

    <h2>BMI vs AGE by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To explore how <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong> are related to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that shows the relationship between these two variables across three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 40px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>Each point on the scatter plot represents an individual, with their <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and their <strong>BMI</strong> on the y-axis. A <strong>horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong> is included to highlight the threshold between normal weight and overweight.</p>
            <p>The plot allows us to examine how BMI and age correlate with diabetes status and identify trends among different groups.</p>
            <p>Key observations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> tend to have a higher BMI and are generally older.</li>
                <li><strong>NonDiabetic individuals</strong> usually have a lower BMI and are younger.</li>

    <h2>AGE vs HbA1c by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand how <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> relate to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that visualizes these variables: <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and <strong>HbA1c</strong> on the y-axis. The plot is color-coded to differentiate between the groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 40px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 350px;">
            <p>In this visualization, we’ve included a <strong>horizontal line at HbA1c = 6.5%</strong>, which is the typical threshold for diagnosing diabetes. This line serves as an important reference point, helping us identify individuals whose HbA1c levels are indicative of diabetes.</p>
            <p>The scatter plot allows us to explore the interaction between <strong>AGE</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong>, shedding light on whether certain age groups are more likely to exceed this threshold and experience poor blood sugar control.</p>
            <p>By examining the plot, we can assess patterns such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are older individuals more likely to have higher HbA1c levels?</li>
                <li>Do Diabetic individuals have higher HbA1c levels compared to NonDiabetic individuals?</li>

    <h2>HbA1c vs BMI by Diabetes Status</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; gap: 30px; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center;">
        <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
            <p>In this scatter plot, we explore the relationship between <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> for individuals categorized as <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong>. Different colors represent each group: <strong>red</strong> for Diabetic, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic, and <strong>green</strong> for PreDiabetes.</p>

            <p>Threshold lines help interpret the data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Horizontal line at BMI = 25</strong> (overweight threshold).</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical lines for HbA1c thresholds</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purple line at 5.7%</strong> (PreDiabetes cutoff).</li>
                        <li><strong>Orange line at 6.5%</strong> (Diabetes threshold).</li>

    <h2>Why This Analysis Matters: Impact & Potential Bias</h2>

    <p>Analyzing data like this isn’t just about numbers—it’s about making a real impact. By understanding the relationships between factors like BMI, AGE, and HbA1c, we can gain valuable insights that might help with early detection and prevention of diabetes. Identifying high-risk individuals means interventions can happen sooner, potentially reducing complications and improving long-term health outcomes. These findings could be useful for healthcare professionals, researchers, and even public health initiatives aiming to curb diabetes rates.</p>

    <p>However, like any analysis, there are limitations and potential biases to consider. One major concern is **selection bias**—if the dataset isn’t representative of the broader population, the findings might not apply universally. There’s also the risk of **confounding variables**, where other hidden factors (like genetics, lifestyle, or socioeconomic status) influence diabetes risk but aren’t accounted for in the data. Additionally, **data quality issues**—such as missing or incorrect information—can skew results and lead to misleading conclusions.</p>

    <p>Despite these challenges, this type of analysis still provides a strong foundation for understanding diabetes risk. While it’s not a perfect predictor, it can guide further research and support better decision-making in healthcare and disease prevention.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion & Insights</h2>

    <p>Throughout this project, we explored diabetes risk factors using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and histograms. The scatter plot demonstrated how BMI and HbA1c interact across different diabetes statuses, with Diabetic individuals tending to have higher BMI and HbA1c values.</p>

    <p>The correlation matrix provided quantitative confirmation of these relationships. It revealed a moderate positive correlation between <strong>BMI and HbA1c (0.46)</strong>, suggesting that individuals with higher BMI often have elevated HbA1c levels. Additionally, we found that <strong>AGE correlates more strongly with Diabetic status (0.48)</strong>, indicating that older individuals are more likely to be diabetic. The histograms further reinforced these trends, showing that Diabetic individuals generally have higher BMI values, while NonDiabetic individuals have lower, more concentrated BMI distributions.</p>

    <p>Reflecting on this project, it has been an insightful learning experience, reinforcing the power of data visualization and statistical analysis in understanding health data. The combination of scatter plots, correlation matrices, and histograms allowed us to build a comprehensive picture of diabetes risk factors. This analysis highlights the importance of considering multiple factors—BMI, HbA1c, and AGE—when assessing diabetes risk. The patterns observed suggest that individuals with higher BMI and HbA1c are at greater risk, and AGE plays a significant role in this likelihood.</p>

    <p>This project underscored the importance of multidimensional analysis in medical research and the value of using data-driven insights to inform healthcare decisions. Understanding the interplay between BMI, HbA1c, and AGE can help guide future research and improve risk assessment strategies for diabetes prevention and management.</p>
