<p>One of the most common questions in diabetes research is how Body
Mass Index (BMI) relates to the likelihood of having diabetes. We
know that excess body weight can be a risk factor for developing
diabetes, but what’s the exact connection? Does a higher BMI
correlate with a higher likelihood of being diabetic?</p>
<p>By understanding the relationship between BMI and diabetes risk,
this project can provide valuable insights that can be used for early
detection and prevention of diabetes. The visualizations will help
identify high-risk individuals, making it easier to target
preventative measures, such as lifestyle changes or medical
interventions, at an earlier stage. This approach has the potential
to reduce the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems and improve
public health outcomes.</p>
<p>To explore this question, we'll visualize the relationship between
BMI and AGE, with different colors representing the diabetes status
(Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic). By plotting this, we can see if there’s
any noticeable pattern between BMI and the likelihood of having
diabetes across different age groups.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can further break down this relationship by using
histograms to compare the BMI distribution between diabetic and
non-diabetic individuals. This will help us understand whether people
with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic, or if other factors
come into play.</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Uncovering Relationships in the Data: The
Correlation Matrix</strong></h3>
<p>To understand how different factors in our dataset relate to each
other, we use a <strong>correlation matrix</strong>. This helps us
identify strong connections between features. For example, <strong>BMI</strong>
has a strong positive correlation with <strong>diabetes status</strong>
(<strong>0.589</strong>) and a moderate positive correlation with
<strong>HbA1c</strong> (<strong>0.455</strong>). This suggests that
individuals with higher BMI are more likely to be diabetic and may
have higher HbA1c levels, a key marker in diabetes risk.<img src="https://github.com/clarktommie/clarktommie.github.io-DiabetesRisk/blob/5f83fc0dd3bd31f8a8879d6ab79caa660ec57321/Exploring%20the%20Link%20Between%20BMI%20and%20Diabetes%20Risk_html_24149d49.gif" name="Image1" align="left" width="322" height="307" border="0"/>
</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>age</strong> shows a moderate positive
correlation with <strong>diabetes status</strong> (<strong>0.478</strong>),
highlighting that older individuals are more likely to develop
diabetes. <strong>HbA1c</strong> also strongly correlates with
<strong>diabetes status</strong> (<strong>0.567</strong>), confirming
the importance of HbA1c levels in predicting diabetes.</p>
<p>These key correlations—particularly between <strong>BMI</strong>,
<strong>HbA1c</strong>, <strong>age</strong>, and <strong>diabetes
status</strong>—will guide our next visualization, where we will
explore how these features interact in more detail.</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Analyzing Key Relationships: Correlation
Between AGE, BMI, HbA1c, and Diabetes Status</strong></h3>
<p>As we dug deeper into the data, we decided to zoom in on four key
factors that we believed had a major impact on diabetes risk: <img src="https://github.com/clarktommie/clarktommie.github.io-DiabetesRisk/blob/85bb66ef28ce4793c9d5523f5ed2e569b0ab1e8e/Exploring%20the%20Link%20Between%20BMI%20and%20Diabetes%20Risk_html_108d280d.gif" name="Image2" align="left" width="279" height="225" border="0"/>
<strong>AGE</strong>,
<strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong>Diabetic
status</strong>. These are all important markers when trying to
assess someone’s likelihood of developing diabetes, so
understanding how they relate to one another was critical.</p>
<p>We started by calculating the correlation between these variables,
which gave us a clearer picture of their connections. What we found
was telling:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>There’s a strong positive relationship between <strong>BMI</strong>
	and <strong>Diabetic status</strong> (<strong>0.589</strong>). This
	makes sense: higher BMI is often linked with a higher risk of
	developing diabetes, which is what we’re seeing here.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>HbA1c</strong> are also
	moderately correlated (<strong>0.455</strong>), further supporting
	the idea that individuals with higher BMI tend to have elevated
	HbA1c levels, another key indicator of diabetes.</p></li>
	<li><p>We also found that <strong>AGE</strong> has a moderate
	positive correlation with <strong>Diabetic status</strong> (<strong>0.478</strong>),
	indicating that as people get older, the likelihood of being
	diabetic increases—a well-known trend in diabetes research.</p></li>
	<li><p>Lastly, <strong>HbA1c</strong> and <strong>Diabetic status</strong>
	showed a strong correlation (<strong>0.567</strong>), emphasizing
	the role HbA1c plays in diagnosing and predicting diabetes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By visualizing these correlations in a heatmap, we could easily
spot these connections and understand how each factor plays a role in
the bigger picture of diabetes risk. This insight sets the stage for
our next step, where we’ll dive deeper into how <strong>BMI</strong>,
<strong>AGE</strong>, and <strong>HbA1c</strong> interact with one
another to better understand the full scope of diabetes risk.</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Analyzing HbA1c Distribution by Diabetes
Status</strong></h3>
<p>In the box plot, the <strong>x-axis</strong> represents <strong>Diabetes
Status</strong>, where <strong>0</strong> corresponds to non-diabetic
individuals and <strong>1</strong> corresponds to those with
diabetes. The <strong>y-axis</strong> displays <strong>HbA1c</strong>
levels, which are crucial for understanding blood sugar control.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Non-Diabetic</strong> group (represented by <strong>0</strong>),
the box plot shows that most <strong>HbA1c</strong> values fall
between <strong>4.3</strong> and <strong>5.8</strong>, with the
median around <strong>5.0</strong>. This indicates that non-diabetic
individuals typically have normal blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>Diabetic</strong> group (represented by
<strong>1</strong>) has a much higher spread of <strong>HbA1c</strong>
values, ranging from <strong>2.0</strong> to <strong>16.0</strong>.
The bulk of the data falls between <strong>7.3</strong> and <strong>10.6</strong>,
with the median at <strong>8.9</strong>. The plot also shows a few
extreme outliers, with some individuals having <strong>HbA1c</strong>
values as high as <strong>16.0</strong>, reflecting poorly controlled
blood sugar.</p>
<p>This comparison between the two groups visually highlights how
much more variable and higher <strong>HbA1c</strong> levels are in
individuals with diabetes compared to those without.</p>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Distribution of BMI by Diabetes Status</strong></h3>
<p>To understand how <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> differs
across various diabetes statuses, we’ve plotted histograms for
three groups: <strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>,
and <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Diabetic</strong>
	individuals are represented in <strong>red</strong>.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>NonDiabetic</strong>
	individuals are represented in <strong>blue</strong>.<strong>PreDiabetes</strong>
	individuals are represented in <strong>green</strong>.Each histogram
	displays the spread of <strong>BMI</strong> values for each group,
	with the <strong>KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)</strong> curve
	providing a smooth estimation of the distribution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="Exploring%20the%20Link%20Between%20BMI%20and%20Diabetes%20Risk_html_71dcaabb.gif" name="Image4" align="left" width="635" height="397" border="0"/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Looking at the data:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> tend to have a higher
	average BMI (<strong>30.82</strong>) with a range from <strong>19.0</strong>
	to <strong>47.75</strong>. The BMI for this group is more spread
	out, with a noticeable peak around <strong>30.0</strong>, showing
	that a significant portion of diabetic individuals fall within the
	higher BMI range.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>NonDiabetic individuals</strong> have a lower average
	BMI (<strong>22.35</strong>) and a tighter distribution, with a
	range from <strong>19.0</strong> to <strong>24.60</strong>. This
	group shows a concentration of BMI values around <strong>22.0</strong>,
	which suggests that most non-diabetic individuals fall within a
	normal BMI range.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>PreDiabetes individuals</strong> have an average BMI
	of <strong>24.11</strong>, with a range from <strong>19.0</strong>
	to <strong>32.0</strong>. The distribution shows a slight shift
	toward higher BMI compared to non-diabetics, but not as high as the
	diabetic group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These histograms make it clear that <strong>Diabetic</strong>
individuals generally have higher BMIs than <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>
individuals, with <strong>PreDiabetes</strong> falling somewhere in
between. This pattern suggests a relationship between higher BMI and
an increased likelihood of developing diabetes, which is something to
consider for further analysis.</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>BMI vs AGE by Diabetes Status</strong></h3>
<p>To explore how <strong>BMI</strong> and <strong>AGE</strong> are
related to diabetes status, we’ve created a scatter plot that shows
the relationship between these two variables across three groups:
<strong>Diabetic</strong>, <strong>NonDiabetic</strong>, and
<strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals. In this plot, we use
different colors to represent each group: <strong>red</strong> for
Diabetic, <strong>blue</strong> for NonDiabetic, and <strong>green</strong>
for PreDiabetes. Each point on the scatter plot corresponds to an
individual, with their <strong>AGE</strong> on the x-axis and their
<strong>BMI</strong> on the y-axis. A horizontal line at <strong>BMI
= 25</strong> was added to highlight the threshold between normal
weight and overweight.</p>
<p>L<img src="Exploring%20the%20Link%20Between%20BMI%20and%20Diabetes%20Risk_html_fcb9c98b.gif" name="Image5" align="left" width="593" height="338" border="0"/>
ooking
at the data:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> have a higher average
	BMI (<strong>30.82</strong>), with values ranging from <strong>19.0</strong>
	to <strong>47.75</strong>. This group also tends to be older, with
	an average age of <strong>55.4 years</strong>. The wide range of BMI
	values suggests that diabetes affects individuals across various
	weight categories, but with a strong tendency toward higher BMIs as
	age increases.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>NonDiabetic individuals</strong> have a lower average
	BMI (<strong>22.35</strong>), typically falling within a normal
	weight range (between <strong>19.0</strong> and <strong>24.60</strong>).
	The average age of this group is <strong>44.3 years</strong>,
	reflecting a younger population compared to diabetics. The BMI
	distribution is tighter, indicating fewer instances of overweight or
	obesity in this group.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>PreDiabetes individuals</strong> have an average BMI
	of <strong>24.11</strong>, with values ranging from <strong>19.0</strong>
	to <strong>32.0</strong>. Their BMI distribution suggests that they
	are at an increased risk of developing diabetes, with more
	individuals falling into the overweight category but not yet
	reaching the higher BMI levels seen in the diabetic group. Their
	average age is <strong>43.4 years</strong>, which is similar to
	non-diabetic individuals, but the higher BMI hints at a potential
	progression towards diabetes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings reinforce the earlier visual observations that
<strong>Diabetic individuals</strong> generally have higher BMIs,
particularly in older age groups, while <strong>NonDiabetic
individuals</strong> maintain a lower BMI and are younger on average.
<strong>PreDiabetes</strong> individuals occupy a middle ground, with
higher BMIs than non-diabetics but lower than those in the diabetic
group. This pattern highlights the relationship between BMI and
diabetes status, underscoring the importance of BMI as a risk factor
in the development of diabetes.</p>
<h3 class="western">HbAc vs BMI by Diabetes Status</h3>
<p>Throughout this project, we used a combination of <strong>scatter
plots</strong>, <strong>correlation matrices</strong>, and <strong>histograms</strong>
to explore the relationships between <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>,
<strong>HbA1c</strong>, and diabetes status. The <strong>scatter plot</strong>
helped us visually assess how these variables interact across the
different diabetes statuses. We saw how <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">BMI</span></strong>
and <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">HbA1c</span></strong>
correlate, especially for <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Diabetic</span></strong>
individuals, with higher <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">BMI</span></strong>
generally corresponding to higher <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">HbA1c</span></strong>.
The <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">correlation</span></strong><strong>
</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">matrix</span></strong>
revealed that <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">BMI</span></strong>
and <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">HbA1c</span></strong>
had a moderate positive correlation (<strong>0.46</strong>), while
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">AGE</span></strong> showed
a slightly weaker correlation with both <strong>BMI</strong> (<strong>0.40</strong>)
and <strong>HbA1c</strong> (<strong>0.40</strong>). Interestingly,
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">AGE</span></strong> was
more strongly correlated with <strong><b>Diabetic</b></strong> <b>status</b>
(<strong>0.48</strong>), suggesting that older individuals in the
dataset were more likely to have diabetes, aligning with what we saw
in the scatter plot.</p>
<p><img src="Exploring%20the%20Link%20Between%20BMI%20and%20Diabetes%20Risk_html_b0369ed.gif" name="Image6" align="left" width="621" height="315" border="0"/>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">histograms</span></strong>
further clarified these patterns, showing that <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Diabetic</span></strong>
individuals tend to have higher <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">BMI</span></strong>
values, while <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">NonDiabetic</span></strong>
individuals have lower, more concentrated <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">BMI</span></strong>
values. In terms of <strong>AGE</strong>, we observed that older
individuals were more likely to fall into the <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Diabetic</span></strong>
group, as indicated by the stronger correlation between <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">AGE</span></strong>
and diabetes status.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this project, it has been an insightful learning
experience that reinforced the power of combining multiple
visualization methods and statistical tools. The <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">correlation</span></strong><strong>
</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">matrix</span></strong>
not only confirmed visual trends but also helped quantify the
relationships between <strong>AGE</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>,
<strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Diabetic</span></strong>
status. Seeing how <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">AGE</span></strong>
plays a significant role in the likelihood of diabetes, alongside the
correlations between <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">BMI</span></strong>
and <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">HbA1c</span></strong>,
helped me understand the multifaceted nature of diabetes risk.</p>
<p>This project has deepened my appreciation for how data
visualization and analysis can tell a comprehensive story about
health data. The insights gained here are not only valuable for
understanding <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">diabetes</span></strong>
but also for guiding future research and decision-making in
healthcare. It’s clear that factors like <strong>BMI</strong>,
<strong>HbA1c</strong>, and <strong>AGE</strong> should all be
considered when assessing diabetes risk, and this project has been a
valuable exercise in how to analyze and visualize such complex
relationships.</p>
